## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Run the Advanced Demo**
```bash
cd "e:\Intel Fest\Fine Tune"
python advanced_ml_lint_demo.py
```

### 2. **Analyze a Single File**
```python
from advanced_ml_lint_agent import AdvancedMLLintAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = AdvancedMLLintAgent()

# Analyze a file with intelligent ML analysis
issues = agent.analyze_file_intelligent("your_code.py", developer_id="your_name")

# Review the intelligent findings
for issue in issues:
    print(f"🔍 {issue.title}")
    print(f"   📝 {issue.description}")
    print(f"   💡 {issue.suggested_fix}")
    print(f"   🧠 ML Reasoning: {issue.ml_reasoning}")
    print(f"   🎯 Confidence: {issue.confidence:.1%}")
```

### 3. **Analyze Entire Project**
```python
# Intelligent project-wide analysis
result = agent.analyze_project_intelligent("./your_project", developer_id="your_name")

print(f"📊 Analysis Results:")
print(f"   Files: {result['stats']['analyzed_files']}")
print(f"   Issues: {result['stats']['total_issues']}")
print(f"   Critical: {result['stats']['critical_issues']}")
print(f"   ML Detected: {result['stats']['ml_detected']}")
print(f"   Report: {result['report_path']}")
```

## 🎯 Key Features in Action

### 🧠 **Multi-Modal ML Analysis**

The agent uses your fine-tuned CodeT5+ model in multiple ways:

1. **Code Review Analysis**
   ```python
   # Multiple prompts for comprehensive analysis
   review_prompts = [
       "Review this code for bugs, issues, and improvements",
       "Analyze this code for potential problems and suggest fixes",
       "What are the main issues in this code? Provide specific suggestions"
   ]
   ```

2. **Security Deep Scan**
   ```python
   security_prompt = """
   Perform a comprehensive security analysis of this code.
   Look for: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication issues, 
   authorization problems, input validation issues, cryptographic 
   weaknesses, and other vulnerabilities.
   """
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   ```python
   perf_prompt = """
   Analyze this code for performance optimizations.
   Focus on: algorithmic complexity, memory usage, I/O operations, 
   database queries, caching opportunities, and bottlenecks.
   """
   ```

### 📚 **Learning & Personalization**

The agent learns from developer feedback:

```python
# Provide feedback to improve future analysis
agent.learn_from_feedback(
    issue_id="abc123",
    developer_id="alice", 
    action="accepted",  # or "dismissed", "modified"
    feedback="Great catch! This was indeed a security issue."
)

# The agent adapts its analysis based on:
# - Developer experience level (beginner/intermediate/expert)
# - Historical feedback patterns
# - Project-specific conventions
# - Team coding standards
```

### 🔒 **Advanced Security Features**

```python
# Enhanced security pattern database
security_patterns = [
    {
        "pattern": r"eval\s*\(",
        "type": "code_injection",
        "severity": "critical",
        "cwe": "CWE-94",
        "fix_template": "Use ast.literal_eval() for safe evaluation"
    },
    {
        "pattern": r"subprocess\.call\s*\(.*shell\s*=\s*True",
        "type": "shell_injection", 
        "severity": "critical",
        "cwe": "CWE-78"
    }
]
```

### ⚡ **Performance Intelligence**

```python
# Intelligent performance analysis
performance_patterns = [
    {
        "pattern": r"for\s+\w+\s+in\s+range\s*\(\s*len\s*\(",
        "impact": "O(n) to O(1) improvement",
        "fix_template": "for i, item in enumerate(items):"
    }
]
```
